# Interoperability of Domain of Competency : State-of-the-Art in 2025

## 1. Introduction

In the contemporary European landscape, the proliferation of numerous skills repositories reflects a deliberate response to the evolving demands of the labor market, the need for greater mobility, and the imperative for lifelong learning. As economies across the continent experience rapid technological transformations and globalization, there is an increasing emphasis on harmonizing education and vocational training with labor market needs. This paradigm shift underscores the necessity for comprehensive skills repositories, which serve as critical tools not only for educators and policymakers but also for employers and learners. These databases aim to standardize skill definitions, facilitate recognition of qualifications across borders, and ultimately enhance employability.

Europe's diverse political, economic, and cultural milieu has led to the development of multiple skills repositories, each catering to different needs and contexts. From the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) system—a hallmark of EU-wide standardization efforts—to national repositories like the Répertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles (RNCP) in France, these platforms embody Europe’s commitment to fostering a coherent labor market. Moreover, they provide vital resources for aligning educational outcomes with job market requirements.

However, the existence of multiple repositories is not without its complications. Each one reflects specific regional priorities and methodologies, creating a tapestry of systems that coexist yet often lack seamless interoperability. Despite these challenges, the repositories collectively represent a significant stride toward addressing skill gaps, improving workforce mobility, and ensuring that the European labor market remains competitive and dynamic in an increasingly globalized world. Through continuous evolution and collaboration, these repositories strive to meet the growing demands of both the current and future workforce.
